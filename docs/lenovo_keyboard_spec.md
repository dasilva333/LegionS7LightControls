# Lenovo Legion Slim 7 16IRH8 – Keyboard Part Number and Keycap Details

## 1. US Keyboard Assembly Part Number (Full Assembly)

For the **Lenovo Legion Slim 7 (16IRH8)**, the official Field-Replaceable Unit (FRU) for the **US QWERTY keyboard assembly (with frame/palmrest, membrane, and keycaps)** is **5CB1L67957**. This part is described by Lenovo’s parts distributors as the *“Cover Upper Case Assembly (Palmrest) – English (US) – 82Y3 – BLWH”*, where **“BLWH” denotes a white backlight**. In other words, 5CB1L67957 is the complete US keyboard+upper-cover assembly with a white LED backlight.

**Note:** Some Legion Slim 7 Gen 8 configurations may offer **per-key RGB backlighting** instead of white. In Lenovo’s parts naming, assemblies with **“RGB”** in the description denote the multi-color backlit keyboards. (For example, a UK “Euro” English layout has FRU 5CB1L67991 for the RGB version.) For the US layout on the 16IRH8 (machine type 82Y3), however, **the available FRU appears to be the white-backlight version (5CB1L67957)** – no separate US RGB FRU is listed for 82Y3, suggesting that the Intel model came standard with white backlight. (The AMD sibling model 16APH8 uses different part numbers prefixed with L83A2 and may have its own RGB variant FRUs.) Overall, **5CB1L67957** is the definitive assembly for the US ANSI keyboard in this model, and we have high confidence in this number as it is confirmed by an authorized Lenovo parts distributor and parts lists.

*(For completeness: Lenovo’s part number format indicates “5CB1L…” for upper cover assemblies. Other regional layouts of the Slim 7 Gen 8 have similar part numbers – e.g. 5CB1L67973 for a French/English bilingual Canada layout (BLWH), 5CB1L67958 for Greek (BLWH), 5CB1L67990 for Greek RGB, 5CB1L68007 for French AZERTY RGB, etc. These variations illustrate that the FRU differs by language and backlight type, even though the underlying keyboard hardware is the same aside from key legends and lighting.)*

---

## 2. Lenovo Keyboard Naming & Keycap Design Codes

**Lenovo’s naming conventions** for keyboard parts embed useful info in the descriptions. In parts lists, **“ASM_[LANG] C 82Y3 BLWH”** indicates an assembly (ASM) for a given language layout (e.g. ENG for English, FRA for French, HUN for Hungarian, etc.), specific to the **82Y3** model (Legion Slim 7 Gen 8 Intel), with **BLWH = White Backlight** (or “RGB” for RGB-backlit versions). For example, the US part above was listed as *“ASM_ENG C 82Y3 BLWH”* and the code “ENG” in this context denotes the **US English (ANSI) layout**. By contrast, “EURO ENG” is used to denote **European English (ISO) layouts** (e.g. UK English with a different Enter key and £ symbol). This convention helps identify layout and lighting at a glance. Additionally, some part descriptions include **“FP” or “NFP”** indicating presence or absence of a fingerprint reader in the assembly (though in the Slim 7 Gen 8, the fingerprint sensor is in the power button and is generally present on all configurations, so the 82Y3 “C” parts don’t split by FP/NFP – that split appears in AMD 82Y4 parts lists).

Regarding **keycap and hinge mechanism identifiers**: Lenovo often sources keyboards from multiple OEMs (Chicony, Lite-On, Sunrex, etc.), which can result in slight differences in the keycap **scissor hinge design**. These differences aren’t explicitly documented in Lenovo’s manuals, but third-party repair vendors classify them. For example, one replacement key supplier shows that the Legion Slim 7 Gen 8 keyboards use two types of hinge clips, labeled **“LC24” and “LC82”**. These codes correspond to the shape of the plastic scissor mechanism under the keycaps – presumably each code maps to a particular manufacturer’s hinge design. In practice, if you order a single key replacement, you must match the hinge type (e.g. LC24 vs LC82) to ensure compatibility. This stems from Lenovo’s use of multiple vendors for the same FRU; while the whole keyboard assembly is interchangeable, the **individual key hinges** are not cross-compatible between the two styles.

In terms of materials, Legion-series laptop keycaps are typically **ABS plastic with a painted or UV-coated finish** (common for illuminated keys). While Lenovo does not publish the exact material spec in the consumer documentation, the durability features are mentioned generally (e.g. “built from premium materials to withstand gaming and everyday typing” in aftermarket descriptions). The scissor switches themselves are low-profile plastic mechanisms; Lenovo’s part listings use internal codes for the mechanism but these aren’t user-facing. Essentially, from a naming standpoint Lenovo identifies the whole keyboard by FRU number and layout code, but **detailed specs like hinge style are managed at the manufacturing level rather than through public part numbers**.

## 3. 3D Models (STL) for Keycaps or Keyboard Parts

**Community-made 3D models** for specific keycaps on this exact model appear to be scarce. Our research did not find any STL files explicitly for “Legion Slim 7 16IRH8” keycaps. However, there are a few related items for **other Lenovo Legion laptops** which could be relevant for DIY solutions:

* A user on Printables has shared a **“Replacement Keycap…Clip Fix” model designed for the Lenovo **Legion Y530** gaming laptop. This model was created to solve broken hinge clip issues on that keyboard. It is essentially a 3D-printable keycap that includes a reinforced clip mechanism. While the Y530 is an older 15″ Legion (circa 2018), its keycap size and scissor design might be similar to other Legion models. This STL (updated November 2024) demonstrates that it’s feasible to print a working replacement keycap, though some tweaking might be needed to fit the Slim 7’s key exactly.

* Another example is an STL for **Lenovo Legion Y720/Y520 keycaps** which has been circulated and even remixed for ThinkPad models. This indicates that hobbyists have modeled the keycap + hinge geometry for Legion series keyboards before. The **Legion Y720/520 keycap model** could potentially serve as a starting point for a Slim 7 key, given that many Legion laptops share a similar keyboard style (the main differences being layout and minor dimension tweaks).

* Aside from keycaps, we found a 3D-printable part for the **Legion Slim 7’s chassis feet** (to elevate the rear of the laptop for better cooling) on Thingiverse. While not a keyboard component, it’s worth noting as it directly references the Legion Slim 7 and shows community interest in modifying that model. This suggests checking sites like Thingiverse, Printables, and GrabCAD for **“Lenovo Legion Slim”** could yield any new uploads in the future.

**Summary:** **No dedicated Slim 7 (16IRH8) keycap STL was located** at this time. However, similar models for other Legion keys exist – particularly the **Legion Y530 keycap STL on Printables** – and could be adapted with measuring and trial fitting. Given the Slim 7’s 2023 release, it’s likely too new for community modeling. If a usable STL is needed now, the fastest approach is to **modify an existing Legion STL**, keeping the hinge geometry and adjusting top dimensions and wall thickness for translucency and lighting diffusion.
